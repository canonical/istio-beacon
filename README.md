[Istio](https://istio.io) is an open source project that implements a service mesh, allowing for a way to observe and control the traffic flow between applications in Kubernetes.  Istio is a key tool in securing Kubernetess workloads and hardening your environment.

The istio-beacon Charmed Operator facilitated adding charms to the Istio service mesh.  The operator is designed to be used in conjunction with [istio-k8s](https://github.com/canonical/istio-k8s-operator) to deploy and configure Istio using Juju.
